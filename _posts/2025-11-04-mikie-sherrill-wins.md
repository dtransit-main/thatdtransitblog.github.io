Election night in New Jersey brought a big race - the 2025 New Jersey gubernatorial election to decide the next Governor of the Garden State. Incumbent Democratic governor Phil Murphy, having held the position since 2018, is term-limited and therefore ineligible to run for re-election. 

As of Election Night, AP News (and other decision desks) called the election in the name of Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and her running mate Dale Galdwell, who held uncharacteristically large margins over the Republican nominee Jack Ciaterelli, and his running mate Jim Gannon. Sherrill, a current U.S. Representative for New Jersey's 11th Distric and former naval office, emerged from a crowded Democratic primary in mid-June, while former state assemblyman Ciattarelli beat out Bill Spadea in their Republican primary.

From a political standpoint, this was a statement from New Jersey voters in terms of the direction they want the state to head. But this is DTransit, so naturally, we're going to focus in on what Mikie Sherrill means for transportation in New Jersey.

## Transportation in New Jersey - An Underrated Issue

The Garden State is the most densely-populated state in the United States, with 9.5 million residents spread across 7,354 square miles, for a measure of 1,292 people per square mile. In a state that is naturally as densely populated, and in extremely close proximity to New York City, Philadelphia and the greater Northeast region, transit is an incredibly important issue. 

As is the case for no other state, New Jersey, as a whole, is entirely reliant on public transportation initiatives. The statewide agency, New Jersey Transit, covers a service area of 5,325 square miles (over 70% of the state!), transporting 225 million people in 2024, as the largest statewide public transit system in the country. 12 commuter rail lines, 3 light rail lines, 253 bus lines and numerous other paratransit services shuttle people into, out of and around New Jersey every single day. The agency as a whole experienced sustained growth and success from its inception through the late 2000s, supported by good funding and legislative advances.

Then, in 2010, New Jersey elected Republican governor Chris Christie, who stalled over major infrastructure advances and restricted funding and growth for New Jersey Transit. The following 8 years proved tough for the agency, who suffered severe reliability and service issues which catapulted into the following years. Even when New Jersey elected Democrat Phil Murphy, who claimed he would "fix NJ Transit if it killed him", it took time for the legislative measure and funding to funnel into actual effects within the system.

But Mikie Sherrill now has a huge opportunity on her hands. With Kris Kolluri at the helm, the agency has seen a recent overhaul in communication standards and sharing information with the public. The agency has pursued massive fleet upgrades across their bus and rail systems, and is undertaking multiple infrastructure expansion projects includes: an expansion to Andover, the Portal Bridge North in the Meadowlands, a revitalization of Hoboken Terminal, and the massive expansion of the Northeast Corridor, known as the Gateway Program. Opportunity is ripe for Mikie Sherrill to make her mark as the true queen of transportation in New Jersey.

## Mikie Sherrill's Case - What She's Done (and Intends To Do)

Sherrill's no stranger to infrastructure improvement projects. As Representative of New Jersey's 11th congressional district, she campaigned heavily for the funding and approval of the Gateway Program and its primary project, the Hudson Tunnel Project (HTP) - earning her the affectionate nickname of "tunnel-obsessed congresswoman".

As she moves to the governor's seat in Trenton, all eyes will be on her, particularly in terms of what she does to defend Gateway and improve the rest of New Jersey's transportation situation. Her [campaign website](https://www.mikiesherrill.com/issues/transportation) is particularly bland when it comes to transportation, using the usual buzzwords and revisiting her past activism - however, it does her highlight her impressive campaigns to get federal funding into New Jersey from both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Gateway Project - the latter of which occurred under the first presidency of Donald Trump. 

She mentions a particularly important point, however, at the end of the page. She notes that "NJ TRANSIT must have a customer-focused mindset, improving its communication with riders and making investments that create a better experience that gets people to work on time..." If you've used NJ Transit, you'll know that information and communication is far from a strong suit - falling lightyears behind comparable agencies like Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North and Boston's MBTA Commuter Rail. It's a particularly underspoken issue of New Jersey Transit, but transforming that aspect of the agency will help the agency's relationship with the passengers, and create an overall improved experience travelling throughout the Garden State.

Furthermore, Sherrill is a supporter of alternative revenue for transit agencies; rather than looking to fare hikes or tax increases, she believes finding sources of revenue through TOD, increased advertising, etc., is a better way to look for the agency of state with the highest property tax rates. This aligns heavily with the recent development coming out of the NJ Transit Corporate Office - the [LAND plan](https://content.njtransit.com/sites/default/files/marketing/website/pdf/REAL_ESTATE_OPPORTUNITY_REPORT.pdf) is a fresh initiative from the agency to increase investment in public transit to increase revenue streams through alternative sources, including retail concessions, industrial hubs, TOD, advertising, and more. Major legislative proposals that increase housing density near NJ Transit stations, in combination with increased revenue, is steering the agency towards a positive direction in terms of accessibility and mobility in the state.

In terms of other future outlooks, it might benefit Sherril to look to new transit connections within New Jersey. As many people say, NJ Transit is quite good at shuttling people into and out of New Jersey, but isn't very good at shuttling people around New Jersey. Initiatives like the Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex rail connection, rethinking bus routes, the Glassboro-Camden Light Rail, and other in-state transit connections that help decongest the roads, and increase connectivity, economic activity, and mobility in the Garden State.

## Transit in New Jersey *might* have a bright outlook under Sherrill

As governor-elect of one of the most important states in the Northeast, Mikie Sherrill has quite the job on her hands. Rising electricity rates, increasing property taxes and federal government relations have dominated the headlines - but transportation in the most densely-populated state isn't far behind. If Sherrill really plays her cards right, if she's able to tap into that "tunnel-obsessed congresswoman" trait, New Jersey could be in for a big, big revolution when it comes to inter- and intra-state travel in the Garden State.
